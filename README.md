uhh just a false password concept for (possibly) being used to hide a login or smth idk
my idea was for this to eventually be for phones to hide sensitive data
maybe could be written into smth like grapheneos for google pixel phones idk thats the end goal.
written in js cuz im too lazy to do python.
