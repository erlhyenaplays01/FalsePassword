uhh just a false password concept for (possibly) being used to hide a login or smth idk
my idea was for this to eventually be for phones to hide sensitive data
maybe could be written into smth like grapheneos for google pixel phones idk thats the end goal.

it works by etting a password then you have to put in the password 4 times for it to register as correct, to deter bruteforcing and to hide your password.
written in js cuz im too lazy to do python.
